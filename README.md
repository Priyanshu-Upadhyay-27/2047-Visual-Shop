- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know? The human eye can distinguish approximately 10 million different colors, but computer vision algorithms can process and analyze images in ways that go beyond human capabilities, such as detecting subtle patterns and recognizing objects at incredible speeds.

## About the Repository

In this repository, I have some amazing projects like a virtual mouse and AI Notebook, with more exciting projects coming in the future. You can explore and implement them according to the provided configurations.

### Projects

- **Virtual Mouse**: Control your mouse using hand gestures captured via your webcam.
- **AI Notebook**:Draw or write in the air using a camera, creating a virtual canvas on the screen. The AI Notebook can also solve math problems written in the air, displaying the results directly in the terminal.

### Requirements for Virtual Mouse

- **IDE**: PyCharm 
- **Python**: 3.8
- **OpenCV**: 4.10.0.84 (for computer vision)
- **Mediapipe**: 0.10.14 (for recognition)
- **autopy**: 4.0 (for mouse control)
- **pyautogui**: 0.9.54 (for mouse control)

### Requirements for AI Notebook

- **IDE**: PyCharm 
- **Python**: 3.10
- **OpenCV**: 4.10.0.84 (for computer vision)
- **Mediapipe**: 0.10.14 (for hand recognition)
- **numpy**: 2.1.2 (for numerical operations)
- **google-ai-generativelanguage**: 0.6.10
- **google-api-core**:  2.21.0
- **google-api-python-client**: 2.149.0
- **os**: Standard Python library (for file handling)
- **math**: Standard Python library (for mathematical operations)
- **Gemini API**: Required for additional functionalities (ensure you have access to it)
